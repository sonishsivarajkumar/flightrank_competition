# FlightRank 2025: Aeroclub RecSys Cup - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains a comprehensive **Python scripts solution** for the FlightRank 2025 Kaggle competition focused on personalized flight recommendations for business travelers.

## Competition Overview

- **Goal**: Build an intelligent flight ranking model that predicts which flight option a business traveler will choose from search results
- **Metric**: HitRate@3 (fraction of search sessions where correct flight appears in top-3 predictions)
- **Challenge**: Group-wise ranking problem with 150K+ search sessions
- **Prize Pool**: $10,000 with bonus for HitRate@3 ≥ 0.7

## 🚀 Quick Start (Optimized Python Solution)

### 1. Download Competition Data

First, download the competition data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aeroclub-recsys-2025/data):
- `train.parquet` - Training data with flight options and selections
- `test.parquet` - Test data for predictions  
- `sample_submission.parquet` - Example submission format
- `jsons_raw.tar.kaggle` - Additional raw data (optional, 50GB+)

Place these files in the same directory as the Python scripts.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Python Solution

Execute the optimized Python solution:

```bash
python quick_start.py
```

Or for more control:

```bash
python main.py --use-cv --ensemble
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Solution

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended for testing)
```bash
python simple_solution.py
```

### Option 2: Production Run (For final submission)
```bash
# Test with subset of data
python production_solution.py

# Full dataset run for competition
python production_solution.py --full-data --convert-json
```

### Option 3: Convert JSON files first
```bash
# Convert JSON to parquet files
python json_to_parquet_converter.py

# Then run solution
python simple_solution.py
```
